# Trading Bot Implementation Progress

## Core Implementation Steps

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
  - [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for trading data structures
  - [x] Build core trading bot logic engine
  - [x] Implement market analysis algorithms (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
  - [x] Create risk management system with dynamic TP/SL

- [x] **Phase 2: Backend API Development**
  - [x] Create bot control endpoints (start/stop/status)
  - [x] Build market analysis API routes
  - [x] Implement position management endpoints
  - [x] Add market data simulation API

- [x] **Phase 3: Frontend Components**
  - [x] Build main app layout and page structure
  - [x] Create trading dashboard component
  - [x] Implement bot control panel with start/stop buttons
  - [x] Build position monitoring table
  - [x] Create profit tracker and target progress display
  - [x] Add market analysis visualization charts

- [x] **Phase 4: Integration & Logic**
  - [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs
  - [x] Implement real-time updates for bot status
  - [x] Add automatic target achievement detection ($100 profit)
  - [x] Create manual override controls (hard start/stop)
  - [x] Implement state persistence and recovery

- [x] **Phase 5: Image Processing & Build**
  - [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
    - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
    - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
    - Ensures all images are ready before testing

- [x] **Phase 6: Testing & Validation**
  - [x] Test bot control functionality via API endpoints
  - [x] Validate market analysis accuracy
  - [x] Test position management and risk controls
  - [x] Verify target achievement and auto-stop functionality
  - [x] Test manual override controls

- [x] **Phase 7: Deployment**
  - [x] Build production version
  - [x] Start server and validate functionality
  - [x] Provide final preview URL
